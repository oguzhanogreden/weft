# `@weftui/router` — Specifications

## Overview

`@weftui/router` is a universal (server + client) nested router for Weft.
It maps a URL to a rendered `Node` tree on both sides:

- **Server** matches an incoming request path, builds a fixed `Router` for that
  request, renders the matched nested page to hydratable HTML, and responds with
  `text/html` (HTTP 404 for not-found).
- **Client** matches `window.location`, swaps pages reactively via the History
  API, and persists unchanged ancestor layouts across navigations.

The package mirrors `packages/dom`: a shared (universal) root, a `./client`
entry, and a `./server` entry.

### Route model — component-as-handler

A route's **component is its handler**. The endpoint carries only the routing
contract (path-param schema + query schema). There is no per-route success-data
schema / loader — server-only data stays with `Boundary.rpc` (backed by the app's
merged `RpcGroup`), and client-side async with `Boundary.suspend`.

### Authoring surface — explicit nested route tree

The tree is authored with the namespaced `Router.layout(...)` and
`Router.route(...)` combinators and sealed with `Router.router(...)` (mirroring
the namespaced core surface — `Component.gen`, `Boundary.catchTag`, `h.div`). The
`Router` symbol is both the service `Context.Tag` (`yield* Router`) and the
authoring namespace; the two roles merge by declaration. The tree is the
**authoring** surface; the compiled `HttpApi` is the **operational** source of
truth. `compile` builds it (via `buildHttpApi`) and `makeRouter` stamps it onto
`RouterDef.httpApi`, where it is the single definition the server dispatch and the
client matcher both read from — so both sides agree on paths and schemas. `HttpApi`
is never the authoring surface.

Every combinator is **fully typed**: a route's and a layout's `component` slot is
a thunk `() => Node<E, R>` (authored with `Component.make` / `Component.gen`, or a
plain `() => Effect.gen(…)`) that the router invokes at render time — mirroring the
`notFound: () => Node` slot, and deferring construction so `href(…)` runs after the
tree is compiled. Those channels aggregate up so the sealed `RouterDef` — and
`RouterApp(def)` — surface a concrete `Node` type with **no `Node<any, any>`** on
the authoring surface.

### Dependency-injection surface

The outlet and the current match's params/query are delivered by **dependency
injection**, not callback arguments:

- **`Router.Outlet`** — a `Context.Tag` whose value is the node to splice. A
  layout's `component` thunk reads it with `const outlet = yield* Router.Outlet`
  and places `[outlet]` like an `h`-style child; the server document shell thunk
  does the same to place the app. It is typed **opaque** as `Node<never, never>` so
  splicing adds nothing to
  the reader's local channels — the subtree's real `E`/`R` are aggregated
  structurally by `Router.layout` / `Router.router`. The router discharges it via
  `Effect.provideService(node, Router.Outlet, …)` at render time, so it is
  **excluded** from a layout's (and the document's) aggregate requirement channel.
- **`Router.params(fields)` / `Router.query(fields)`** — accessors that read the
  **live match** (`yield* Router` → `currentMatch.get`) and pick the requested
  `fields` keys from the decoded path/query, returning the typed values
  **directly** — the matcher already decoded them against the leaf's full schema,
  so there is no re-validation. They fail with a tagged **`RouterParamsError`**
  (`source: "path" | "query"`, plus the requested `keys`) **only when no route
  matches** (`NotFound`); a matched route that simply lacks a requested key reads
  it as `undefined`. Any component — not just the leaf — may read them; the
  `RouterParamsError` bubbles to the app node's `E` (a user may
  `Boundary.catchTag("RouterParamsError", …)`).

### Handler-arg props surface (leaf components)

In addition to the DI accessors, a **leaf** `component` may declare typed
handler-arg props and receive the live match's decoded data directly:

- **`RouteHandlerProps<Path, Query>`** — `{ path: FieldsType<Path>; query:
FieldsType<Query> }`. The router passes `{ path, query }` into the leaf slot at
  render time (`outlet.ts` `renderLevel`); the slot's `path`/`query` are inferred
  from the route's `path`/`query` fields (the `makeRoute` props-form overload), so
  `component: ({ path, query }) => …` is fully typed with no annotation.
- This is **leaf-only** — layouts and deeper nodes can't take handler args, so they
  keep DI (`Router.params` / `Router.query` / `Router.Outlet`). A zero-arg thunk or
  a `Component.make` / `Component.gen` leaf ignores the props and reads via DI; both
  forms remain valid.

## Authoring API

```ts
// A leaf page. `component` reads the match either via handler-arg props
// (`({ path, query }) => Node`) or via DI (`Router.params` / `Router.query`).
Router.route(segment, { path?, query?, component })

// A layout wrapping an outlet. `component` is a ComponentSlot splicing Router.Outlet.
// A layout owns no path/segment — it is purely UI nesting.
Router.layout({ component }, children)

// Seal the tree into a RouterDef.
Router.router(root, { notFound })
```

- `segment` is a **route-only** argument, **relative to the parent** and may
  contain `:name` path-param placeholders (e.g. `"users/:id"`). A leading/trailing
  `/` is tolerated. Each child route carries its **full relative path** down to the
  leaf (e.g. `"users/:id/settings"`).
- **Layouts have no `segment` or `path`** — they only wrap an outlet (purely UI
  nesting); all path structure lives on routes. A layout that needs a param reads
  it via `Router.params`.
- `path` / `query` are `Schema.Struct.Fields` (record of name → `Schema`) declared
  **only on routes**. The compiler covers every `:name` on the route's pattern in
  the leaf's `pathSchema`, defaulting to `Schema.String` when a placeholder has no
  declared field. Query fields are all optional by default.
- Both a page's and a layout's `component` is a **`ComponentSlot`** — a callable
  producing a `Node`, passed **uncalled**: a `Component.make(() => …)` /
  `Component.gen(function* () { … })` component, or a plain `() => Node` thunk (e.g.
  `() => Effect.gen(…)`). The router invokes it per render: a page reads
  `Router.params` / `Router.query`; a layout splices `yield* Router.Outlet` wherever
  the child level should appear. Its `E`/`R` channels are recovered (via `SlotNode`)
  and propagate up the tree. The callable form matches `notFound` and defers `href`
  resolution to render time.

## Acceptance criteria

### Tree compilation (`compile.ts`)

- **C1** `compile(def)` returns one **leaf descriptor** per `route()` in the
  tree, in document order.
- **C2** Each leaf's `fullPathPattern` is the `/`-joined concatenation of the
  **route** segments on its branch (layouts contribute none), normalized to a
  single leading `/` and no trailing `/` (root leaf ⇒ `/`).
- **C3** Each leaf's `pathSchema` is a `Schema.Struct` merging the path fields
  declared at **every level down its branch** (leaf wins on key collision).
- **C4** Each leaf's `querySchema` is the `Schema.Struct` of its own query
  fields (empty struct when none).
- **C5** Each leaf carries its `layoutChain`: the ordered list of ancestor
  layouts (root → … → parent) plus the leaf component, used to build the nested
  UI. Each layout's dedupe `patternPrefix` is the **longest common path prefix of
  the leaves in its subtree** (so an ancestor layout persists across navigation and
  re-renders only when a param shared by all its leaves changes).
- **C6** Every `:name` placeholder in a **route** segment on the branch has a
  corresponding key in `pathSchema` (defaulted to `Schema.String` if not
  declared).

### Matching (`matcher.ts`)

`match(def, url)` / `compileMatchers(def)` take the whole {@link RouterDef}. The
patterns and path/query schemas are read from the authoritative `def.httpApi`
`"pages"` endpoints — the **single source of truth** the server dispatch also reads
— and each match's render-metadata `leaf` is resolved from `def.compiled` by endpoint
`id` (the `httpApi ↔ compiled` join key). Matching itself stays **local** (SPA
URL→leaf): platform has no client-side "match this URL locally" utility, so the regex
matcher is fed from the HttpApi definition rather than running a platform server in the
browser (refactor _Feasibility constraint_). The compiled entries are memoized per
`RouterDef`.

- **M0** `compileMatchers` sources every entry's path template + `pathSchema`/
  `querySchema` from a `def.httpApi` `"pages"` endpoint, joining to the compiled
  leaf by endpoint `id`; it does **not** read `Compiled.leaves` for patterns/schemas.
- **M1** A static pattern (`/about`) matches exactly that path and nothing else.
- **M2** A path-param pattern (`/users/:id`) matches `/users/42`, capturing
  `id = "42"` (raw), then decoded via `pathSchema` (e.g. to `number`).
- **M3** Trailing slashes are normalized: `/users/42` and `/users/42/` match the
  same leaf.
- **M4** Query strings decode through `querySchema` (`Schema.decode`); absent
  optional keys are omitted/undefined.
- **M5** No matching leaf ⇒ `match` returns `Option.none()` (router falls back to
  the not-found page).
- **M6** More specific (static) segments win over param segments at the same
  position (e.g. `/users/new` beats `/users/:id` when both exist).
- **M7** A path-param decode failure (e.g. `:id` is `Schema.NumberFromString`
  and the value is `"abc"`) ⇒ no match (`Option.none()`), not a thrown error.
- **M8** A query decode failure (a **declared** query field whose value violates
  its schema, e.g. `?page=abc` for `Schema.NumberFromString`) ⇒ no match, like a
  path decode failure — not a thrown error. Excess/undeclared query keys are
  ignored by `Schema.Struct`, so only declared-but-invalid values fall through.

### `href` (`href.ts`)

- **H1** `href(leafRef, { path, query })` encodes path params into the pattern
  (`/users/:id` + `{ id: 42 }` ⇒ `/users/42`).
- **H2** Query values encode through the query schema into a search string,
  sorted by key for stability; absent optional values are omitted.
- **H3** `href` round-trips with `match`: `match(href(ref, args))` yields back
  the same leaf and `args`.
- **H4** Path params are **required** in `href`'s argument type; query is
  optional when every query field is optional.

### Outlet persistence (`src/outlet.ts`)

- **O1** `RouterOutlet` renders the nested chain for the current match: each
  layout wraps the next level's outlet, the leaf renders the page.
- **O2** Each layout level is a reactive **stream child** keyed by
  `(pattern + the param values that level depends on)` and `dedupe`d, so an
  unchanged ancestor layout stays mounted across a navigation that only changes a
  deeper level.
- **O3** Navigating to a sibling under the same layout swaps **only** the inner
  outlet; the layout DOM node identity is preserved.

### Server render + 404 (`server/router-server.ts`)

Server dispatch runs **through `@effect/platform` `HttpApiBuilder`** — platform owns
request→leaf matching and path/query decode. The handler builds a dispatch-only
**server-local** `HttpApi`: `def.httpApi` (pristine — the client and S4 read it)
extended with a second `"fallback"` group holding one catch-all `"*"` endpoint.
`HttpApiBuilder.group("pages", …)` registers one handler per leaf `id` receiving the
platform-decoded `{ path, urlParams }`; the `"fallback"` handler serves any URL no
leaf claims (platform ranks static/param routes above the `"*"` wildcard). Status is
sourced from this pipeline — there is **no render-time status side-channel**
(`RouterApp` no longer takes an `onNotFound` callback; `RouterAppOptions` is removed).

- **S1** `RouterServer.render(def, { document, url })` dispatches `url` through the
  builder, builds a fixed-match server `Router` from the platform-decoded
  `{ path, urlParams }`, injects the outlet into the `document` shell via
  `Router.Outlet`, and renders it via `renderToStringHydratable`, returning
  `{ html, status: 200 }`. `document` is a `ComponentSlot` (the same callable form
  as the route/layout `component` slot — a plain `() => Node` thunk or a
  `Component.make` / `Component.gen` component); the router provides both
  `Router.Outlet` (the app, per request) and `Router`, so the shell may use either.
  Platform-decoded path params are readable by the page via `Router.params`.
- **S2** `status` is `404` for both not-found shapes, sourced from the platform
  pipeline. **No-match** routes to the catch-all handler, which renders the not-found
  page **inside** the level-0 reactive region (markers present) — matching the client
  outlet for an unmatched URL. A **page-raised `RouterNotFound`** surfaces from the
  matched leaf handler (the server omits `RouterApp`'s boundary so the failure
  propagates), and the page renders **directly** in the shell (no outlet markers) —
  matching the client's internal not-found boundary fallback. Both align for hydration.
- **S2a** `RouterServer.toWebHandler(def, { document })` returns the platform
  `(Request) => Promise<Response>` directly (memoized per `(def, document)`); a
  matched route replies `text/html` 200, a no-match replies the not-found page at 404.
- **S3** The server `Router`'s `navigate` is a no-op-ish failure path (navigation
  is a client concern); `currentMatch` is the fixed match for the request.
- **S4** `makeRouter(...)` stamps `RouterDef.httpApi` — built by `buildHttpApi` from
  the compiled leaves — with one `"pages"` group whose endpoints are GET endpoints,
  one per leaf, named by the leaf `id` (the `httpApi ↔ compiled` join key), at each
  leaf's `fullPathPattern`, with `setPath(pathSchema)`, `setUrlParams(querySchema)`,
  a `Schema.String` success, and a `RouterNotFound → 404` error. The leaf
  `pathSchema`/`querySchema` encoded sides are typed string-encodeable, so the
  `setPath`/`setUrlParams` bridge carries **no `as any`** casts.

### Streaming SSR (`RouterServer.toStreamingWebHandler`)

```ts
RouterServer.toStreamingWebHandler(def: RouterDef, options: Options): (request: Request) => Promise<Response>
```

A **separate function** from `toWebHandler` (not a flag): same `Options` shape
(`document`, optional `rpc`), memoized separately from the buffered handler.
`RouterServer.render` and `RouterServer.toWebHandler` stay fully buffered —
changing them is explicitly out of scope.

The handler adopts the **shell-gate** model (Next.js parity), built on the dom
package's shell-split API
(`packages/dom/src/server/streaming-shell.specs.md`): per matched leaf, the
document is rendered via `renderToHydratableShell`; the buffered `shell` (the
full document with Suspense fallbacks inline) decides the HTTP status _before_
any bytes flush, then `<!DOCTYPE html>\n` + shell goes out as the first body
chunk and the Suspense patch chunks are streamed after it
(`HttpServerResponse.stream`), headers `text/html`.

Status semantics:

| Failure shape                                                                   | When decided | Status  | Body                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Platform no-match (no leaf claims the URL)                                      | before flush | **404** | catch-all → `notFound` page, shell-buffered (same as today's S2)                                    |
| `RouterNotFound` raised during the shell walk                                   | before flush | **404** | caught (existing S2 `renderLeaf` semantics) → `notFound` page rendered direct — nothing flushed yet |
| `RouterNotFound` (or any unhandled cause) inside `Boundary.suspend` after flush | after flush  | **200** | patch swaps in the router's `notFound()` page + injects `<meta name="robots" content="noindex">`    |
| Other shell errors                                                              | before flush | **500** | unchanged platform behaviour                                                                        |

The late-404 row (Next.js soft-404 pattern) is wired by providing the dom
package's `SuspenseFailureHandlerTag` to the render:
`handle = (cause) => isRouterNotFound(cause) ? Option.some({ content: <compiled notFound page>, markNoindex: true }) : Option.none()` —
non-`RouterNotFound` causes keep the dom default (swallowed, fallback
persists, per `render-to-stream.specs.md` AC-ST8).

- **SW1** Same status table as above; each row is an acceptance criterion.
- **SW2 (first-chunk timing)** The shell (status + `<!DOCTYPE html>\n` + full
  document with fallbacks) flushes before any pending `Boundary.suspend`
  child resolves — a slow suspended child never delays the first chunk.
- **SW3** The response stream terminates after all patches have been emitted
  (or stays open while a boundary never resolves, per dom AC-SS6 — connection
  timeouts are the HTTP server's concern).
- **SW4** A page with no `Boundary.suspend` produces a single-chunk body,
  byte-identical (modulo chunking) to `toWebHandler`'s buffered body for the
  same request.
- **SW5** Consumer disconnect (response stream cancelled) interrupts pending
  Suspense resolution fibers via the render scope
  (`streaming-shell.specs.md` AC-SH6).
- **SW6** `Boundary.rpc` **blocks** the shell (resolved inline during the
  walk, never patched) — documented, not changed; a slow rpc delays the first
  chunk.
- **SW7** `POST /_eui/rpc` delegation is unchanged: when `rpc` is configured
  the path is claimed by the rpc web handler exactly as in `toWebHandler`;
  without `rpc` it falls through to page dispatch.

**Hydration note / open question (implementation session):** the client
`hydrate` contract over patched regions is the existing
`renderToStream`/`suspense-ssr.specs.md` contract (patches have executed
before `hydrate()` runs). The streamed not-found patch content is **not**
hydrated as the notFound route — the client router resolves the URL itself on
hydrate, so the shell-said-"page"/patch-said-"not-found" case is a potential
hydration mismatch to be resolved during implementation.

Out of scope for this feature: progressive shell flushing (the shell is
atomic), streaming for `RouterServer.render` (string API stays buffered), and
a `redirect()`-after-flush analog.

### Dependency injection (`router-service.ts`, `outlet.ts`)

- **D1** A layout's `component` thunk reads its outlet via `yield* Router.Outlet`; the router
  provides it per render, and the layout's aggregate `R` (and the sealed app's `R`)
  **excludes** `Router.Outlet`.
- **D2** `Router.params(fields)` returns the live match's decoded path params for
  the requested `fields`, typed as `Schema.Struct.Type<fields>`; `Router.query`
  does the same for the query. Both are readable from **any** component, not just
  the leaf.
- **D3** `Router.params` / `Router.query` return the live match's already-decoded
  values **directly** (no re-validation) and fail with a `RouterParamsError`
  (`source: "path" | "query"`, carrying the requested `keys`) **only when no route
  is matched** (`NotFound`). The error bubbles into the app node's aggregate `E`.
  A matched route lacking a requested key reads it as `undefined`.
- **D4** A layout declares **no** `path`; a `:name` introduced by a layout segment
  is keyed on the leaf's `pathSchema` (defaulted to `Schema.String`), and a layout
  that needs the value reads it via `Router.params`.
- **D5** A **leaf** `component` may declare `RouteHandlerProps<Path, Query>` props;
  the outlet passes the live match's decoded `{ path, query }` into the slot at
  render time. The props' `path`/`query` are inferred from the route's
  `path`/`query` fields. Layouts/deeper nodes keep DI (handler args are leaf-only);
  a zero-arg or `Component` leaf ignores the props and reads via `Router.params`.

### Not-found (`errors.ts`)

- **N1** `notFound()` returns an `Effect` failing with `RouterNotFound`.
- **N2** `RouterNotFound` is exported so a user can place a
  `Boundary.catchTag("RouterNotFound", …)` to override the fallback for a subtree.
- **N3** The router config's `notFound` page renders for both "no route matched"
  and an uncaught `RouterNotFound` raised by a page.

### Link interception (`client/link.ts`)

- **L1** A plain `h.a({ href })` to a same-origin, route-matching URL performs
  SPA navigation (no full page load) when clicked.
- **L2** Modified clicks (ctrl/meta/shift/alt, non-left button), `target=_blank`,
  `download`, external origins, and non-matching hrefs fall through to a full
  load (interceptor does not call `preventDefault`).
- **L3** The interceptor is attached for the lifetime of the `Router` layer scope
  and detached on teardown.

### Client runtime — derived `HttpApiClient` (`client/router-live.ts`)

- **CL1** `RouterLive(def, options?)` derives a real `HttpApiClient` from
  `def.httpApi` (over `FetchHttpClient`) and exposes it on the `Router` service as
  `httpApiClient: Option.some(client)` for network work (route prefetch, foundation
  for future loaders/data). The server's fixed-match `Router` exposes
  `Option.none()` — the server is itself the origin.
- **CL2** The client `baseUrl` is configurable via `options.baseUrl`, defaulting to
  the document's same origin (`window.location.origin`).
- **CL3** Deriving the client does **not** change SPA resolution: `currentMatch` and
  the link interceptor still resolve URLs through the **local** {@link match}er
  (which reads the same `def.httpApi`), so both the local matcher and the network
  client agree because they read one definition.

### Reactive accessors (`router-service.ts`)

`Router.paramsStream(fields)` / `Router.queryStream(fields)` are the **reactive**
counterparts to the snapshot `Router.params` / `Router.query`. Each returns an
`Effect<Subscribable<FieldsType<fields>>, never, Router>` derived from
`currentMatch.changes`, so a component can render `[(yield* Router.queryStream(q)).changes]`
and update **in place** without the outlet remounting the leaf.

- **R1** `paramsStream(fields)` / `queryStream(fields)` resolve (via `yield* Router`)
  to a `Subscribable` whose `get` reads the live match's decoded path/query for the
  requested `fields` (same picked values as `Router.params` / `Router.query`).
- **R2** The `Subscribable.changes` stream **re-emits** the picked values on every
  `currentMatch` change (every navigation), including query-only changes that keep
  the same leaf mounted (where a snapshot read would not update).
- **R3** Unlike the snapshot accessors, the reactive form is **resilient on
  `NotFound`**: it yields the empty subset (each requested field `undefined`) rather
  than failing, so the stream stays live across navigations to/from unmatched URLs.

### Client navigation (`client/navigation.ts`)

Programmatic, type-safe navigation built on the `Router` service and the type-safe
`href` builder, mirroring the History API the client `Router` layer is backed by.

- **NV1** `navigate(ref, args, options?)` builds the URL via `href(ref, args)` (so it
  round-trips with `match`) and navigates; `args` follows `href`'s requiredness
  (`path` required when the route has params, `query` optional when all query fields
  are optional). Returns `Effect<void, never, Router>`.
- **NV2** `push(to)` / `replace(to)` navigate to a raw `path + search` string;
  `replace` sets `options.replace` so the client layer uses `history.replaceState`
  (no new history entry) while `push` uses `history.pushState`.
- **NV3** `back()` / `forward()` step through History via `history.go(-1)` /
  `history.go(1)`; the client layer's `popstate` handler resyncs `currentMatch`.
  They require no service (only `window.history`).
- **NV4** `setQuery(query, options?)` replaces the current route's query entirely;
  `patchQuery(partial, options?)` merges into the current decoded query. Both
  re-encode through the **matched leaf's `querySchema`**, preserve the path (so the
  leaf — and any `queryStream` reader — stays mounted), and are a **no-op** when no
  route is currently matched.
- **NV5** The client `Router` service's `navigate(to, options?)` honours
  `options.replace` (`history.replaceState` vs `pushState`); the server's fixed-match
  `Router` ignores it (navigation is a client concern).

### Param / query decode on both sides

- **P1** On the server, the matched leaf's `path`/`query` decode once per request
  and are exposed via the fixed `Router` and the page `component` args.
- **P2** On the client, navigation re-decodes `path`/`query` for the new match
  and re-renders the affected outlet level(s) only.
- **P3** A server-only dependency referenced in client (`render`) code is rejected
  by `AssertNoServerOnly` at the `hydrate` call site (inherited from
  `@weftui/dom/client`).

## `Boundary.rpc` interplay (rpc data foundation)

`Boundary.rpc` resolves through the ambient `AppRpcClientTag` seam (defined in
`@weftui/core`), which the router provides on **both** sides over the app's
merged `RpcGroup` (passed as `RouterServer`/`RouterLive`'s **optional**
`rpc: { group, handlers }` option):

- **Server** (`RouterServer`): provides an **in-process** flat client
  (`RpcTest.makeClient(group, { flatten: true })` over the handler Layer, no
  protocol/serialization) into the SSR render layer, so SSR `Boundary.rpc` regions
  resolve in-process and inline their payload. The combined web handler delegates
  `POST /_eui/rpc` to an `RpcServer.toWebHandler(group, { layer: handlers + JSON })`,
  and every other path to the page `HttpApi` handler.
- **Client** (`RouterLive`): provides a **network** flat client
  (`RpcClient.make(group, { flatten: true })` over `RpcClient.layerProtocolHttp`)
  posting to `<origin>/_eui/rpc`.

This makes all three `Boundary.rpc` paths work end to end:

- **Initial SSR navigation** — server resolves in-process + inlines the payload;
  the client replays during `hydrate` (no rpc call).
- **Refetch** — the hydrated region's `Resource.refetch` calls the network client
  (`POST /_eui/rpc`) and patches in place.
- **Client-first navigation** — SPA-navigating into a page with a `Boundary.rpc`
  (no SSR payload) renders the boundary's `fallback`, forks a network rpc call, and
  swaps in the live subtree. This was a documented `Boundary.server` limitation; the
  rpc seam dissolves it (the same client serves SSR-replay, refetch, and mount).

A router-less mount (no `RouterLive`/`RouterServer`) has no `AppRpcClientTag`, so a
`Boundary.rpc` mount fails with a descriptive error (see `@weftui/dom/client`).

The `rpc` option is **optional** on both sides — an app with no `Boundary.rpc`
omits it entirely:

- **Server** (`RouterServer`): without `rpc`, no rpc web handler is mounted —
  `POST /_eui/rpc` falls through to page dispatch (the catch-all 404) — and the
  SSR render layer provides a stub `AppRpcClientTag` whose `call` fails with a
  descriptive "no `rpc` option was passed to RouterServer" error, so a stray
  `Boundary.rpc` surfaces the misconfiguration instead of crashing.
- **Client** (`RouterLive`): without `rpc` (the whole options argument may be
  omitted), no network rpc client is built; the provided `AppRpcClientTag` is the
  same descriptive-failure stub.
