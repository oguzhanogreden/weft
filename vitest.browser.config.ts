/**
 * Vitest browser-mode configuration for end-to-end / real-browser tests.
 *
 * Kept separate from the default `vp test` (node/jsdom) run: this config only
 * picks up `*.browser.test.{ts,tsx}` files and executes them inside a real
 * Chromium instance driven by Playwright. The Playwright provider ships with
 * Vite+ (`vite-plus/test/browser-playwright`); only the `playwright` package and
 * its browser binaries are installed separately (`playwright install chromium`).
 *
 * Run via `vp run test:browser` (see root `vite.config.ts`).
 *
 * The config is authored as a typed object (rather than wrapped in
 * `defineConfig`) so the type-aware linter resolves `browser.provider` cleanly;
 * Vite+ accepts a default-exported config object directly.
